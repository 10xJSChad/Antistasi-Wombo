General Changes:
- Engineer can construct anywhere.

- Losing undercover by offroading too far no longer reports your vehicle.

- Enemies will no longer call in mortar strikes on you in response to 
  squadmates dying if your exact location is unknown.

- Black market temporarily disabled. 
  (might become permanent if a replacement is developed)

- Rivals will no longer call in roving mortars on your HQ or black market.

- Implemented camo system, your visibility to enemies now changes 
  depending on what you're wearing, civ clothes, backpacks, vests, and helmets
  will all increase your visibility.

- Commander no longer loses points when withdrawing money from faction.

- Removed "driver in all your vehicles" fast travel requirement.

- Increased the fast travel valid click radius from 50 to 150 meters.
  This means that you can now click 3x further away from the marker
  than before when fast traveling.


Missions:
- New Mission: "Liberate Town"
  A local warlord has taken over a town, and with the help of corrupt occupier soldiers
  looking to make a quick buck, has started to sell weapons to criminal organizations around
  Altis. Kill the bandits and liberate the town, but feel free to take their weapons cache on
  your way out!

- Completing a 'Kill the Traitor'  mission now lowers the occupant aggression. 
- Completing a 'Kill the Official' mission now lowers the aggression of the target faction.


Groups:
- Removed chance for Spec Ops and Rival units to spawn as Explosives Experts.
  They just spam landmines while patrolling. If you go afk for a bit while they're 
  active, you're in for a fun time when you discover the minefield they've created.
  It's just annoying.


Altis:
  - Removed Rifleman and Team Leader roles.
